## **Project Description**

The To-Do App is a **full-stack web application** designed for managing tasks. It features a single, dynamic page where users can interact with all functionalities.

### **Frontend**
The frontend is built with **React** and consists of a **single page** with three main components:
* A **Header** at the top.
* A **Task Input Area** for adding new tasks.
* A **Task List** that displays all the tasks.

### **Backend**
The backend, built with **Node.js** and **Express**, serves as a **RESTful API**. It handles all the data logic and interacts with a **MySQL database** to perform the following operations:
* **GET**: Retrieve all tasks.
* **POST**: Create a new task.
* **PUT**: Update an existing task.
* **DELETE**: Remove a task.

### **Setup & Installation**
To run the app, you need to set up the MySQL database via **XAMPP**, and then run the frontend and backend servers separately in your terminal. All the code for the project is available on a **GitHub repository** for easy access and collaboration.
